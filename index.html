              Merida, city, capital of Yucatán estado (state), southeastern
              Mexico. It lies near the northwestern tip of the Yucatán
              Peninsula, about 20 miles (30 km) south of Progreso, its port on
              the Gulf of Mexico. In 1542 Francisco de Montejo gave the name
              Mérida to the captured Mayan city T’ho (Tihoo). An early base for
              Spanish efforts to conquer the Maya, it subsequently became an
              administrative and commercial centre for the Yucatán region. In
              the 19th century its economy was based on the processing and
              export of locally grown henequen, a fibrous plant from which twine
              and rope are produced. By the early 20th century Mérida became one
              of Mexico’s most important commercial cities, but the henequen
              trade declined precipitously after World War II. Many former
              henequen plantations now grow citrus fruits (notably limes and
              lemons) and other crops.

          <h2>Merida, a culinary paradise</h2>
          <h5>My favorite dish of the traditional Yucatecan Cuisine</h5>
          <div class="section-content">
            <p>
              Relleno Negro (Black Stuffing) is a cuisine dish from Yucatán,
              México, based on turkey, pork and mixed chili peppers (chilmole).
              It is traditionally prepared in the month of November in a
              festival called Hanal Pixán. The original recipe contains turkey,
              ground pork to make the but (meatball), tomato, chilmole, achiote,
              black pepper, cloves, cumin, oregano, epazote, garlic and boiled
              eggs. The black color for the stew comes from the mixture and
              toast of the chilies that are used in the chilmole, among which we
              can find: ancho chili, black peppers, cloves, cumin, natural
              achiote, burnt tortillas, sour orange juice, garlic, oregano and
              salt.
